.homeworkNav{ you need a . to create a class -

  will select anything under the class="homeworkNav" tag- (this is how to reference in HTML)
}

.homeworkNav a { targets all the a under the homeworkNav
}

  to reference different atributes on HTML - space between attributyes

  to reference different atributes on CSS - use the (,) comma

  for example <h1>, <h2>, <h3> - changes all the <hs> {
  	color: purple;
  }

  what is a child? lis for example,  <ol> <li> - cause <li> is inside the <ol>

  if you have <ol> <li> <a> - the a is a child of the li, not the <nav> 

  when you use the > symbol you are saying: affect the immediate child of this class

  Exact Match combination:
  	p.myclass { no space in bwetween the p and myclass} 

 nav.homeworknNav { means I only want the class homeworknav that is under the nav tag }
